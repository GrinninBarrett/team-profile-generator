## Challenges
* It was difficult to organize the logic in order to be sure that after the user entered the manager's information, they could have the option to add another employee or not. Then after that, I needed to be sure they would be asked again after each new employee was added. It ended up not being so complicated, but coming to the final solution took some tinkering.
* At first, writing the tests was a bit of a challenge, but once I became more comfortable with the syntax and general approach, it was relatively easy.


## Future Development
In the future, I would like to add validation to be sure that what the user enters is a valid type of information for the given question (for example, being sure an email address is written in an appropriate format, or simply that the user entered something at all).
